# aspma-lab3
Aspma-lab3 for SMC Master - UPF

In this work I tried to compare tag classification vs tag + keywords in description classification.

For doing that, I chose 3 classes that I think that are very difficult to classify using sound-based approach, which are electric, acoustic and distorted guitar.

I also removed random shuffle for dataset in order to be able to compare results from:

Part B - Classification.ipynb and Classification.ipynb
